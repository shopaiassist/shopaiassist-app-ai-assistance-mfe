# Lib Directory Structure

## Overview
This README provides a detailed overview of the `lib` directory within our Node.js server. The `lib` (short for "library") directory is a central place for all utility functions, helper methods, and shared functionalities that are used across various parts of the server.

## Purpose of the Lib Directory
The main purpose of the `lib` directory is to:
- Provide a centralized repository of reusable code modules.
- Enhance code maintainability and reduce redundancy.
- Facilitate easier testing and debugging of shared functions.

## Structure of the Directory
The `lib` directory can contain various files and subdirectories, depending on the needs of the project. A typical structure might look like this:
```
lib/
├── utils/
│   ├── dateUtils.ts
│   ├── stringUtils.ts
│   └── [other utility files]
├── helpers/
│   ├── authHelper.ts
│   ├── errorHelper.ts
│   └── [other helper files]
└── shared/
    ├── constants.ts
    ├── types.ts
    └── [other shared resources]
```

### Utility Functions (`utils/`)
- Contains generic utility functions like date manipulation, string formatting, etc.
- These are general-purpose functions that can be used in various parts of the application.

### Helper Functions (`helpers/`)
- Includes functions that provide assistance in specific tasks, like authentication, error handling, etc.
- Helpers usually abstract away some of the complexity and repetitive code.

### Shared Resources (`shared/`)
- Contains shared constants, types, interfaces, etc.
- This ensures that there's a single source of truth for common data structures and values used across the server.

## Guidelines for Adding New Code
- Ensure that any new utility or helper function added to this directory has a broad enough scope to be used in multiple parts of the application.
- Avoid placing business logic specific to a particular feature or module within this directory. Such logic should reside in the respective feature/module directory.
- Write modular, well-documented code with clear function names and comments explaining the purpose of the code.

## Best Practices
- Regularly refactor and review the code in the `lib` directory to ensure it remains relevant and efficient.
- Write unit tests for utility and helper functions to ensure reliability and ease future refactoring.

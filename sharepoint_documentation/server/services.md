## Overview

The  Assistance MFE server includes various services that provide functionality for backend URL configuration, API request handling, and other server-side operations. These services are designed to be modular and reusable, following the principle of separation of concerns.

## AI Assistance Service

The `AIAssistanceService` is the primary service for the Assistance MFE. It provides functionality for determining the appropriate backend URL based on the user's region and other configuration parameters.

### Key Functions

#### getBackendUrl

Determines the appropriate backend URL based on the user's region:

```typescript
public static getBackendUrl(region?: string): string {
  // Implementation that returns the appropriate backend URL based on region
  // For example, different regions might use different backend services
  // or different endpoints within the same service
}
```

This function is used by the routes to determine where to proxy requests:

```typescript
const backendApiUrl = new URL(AIAssistanceService.getBackendUrl(req.user?.region));
```

## Service Integration

The server services are integrated with the routes and other server components through dependency injection and static methods. This allows for flexible configuration and easier testing.

### Route Integration

The services are used by the routes to determine how to handle requests:

```typescript
export class AIAssistanceRoutes {
  private static getProxyHostUrl(req: AppRequest): string {
    const backendApiUrl = new URL(AIAssistanceService.getBackendUrl(req.user?.region));
    return `${backendApiUrl.protocol}//${backendApiUrl.host}`;
  }
  
  // Other route methods that use the service
}
```

### Express Application Integration

The services are also integrated with the Express application through middleware and route handlers:

```typescript
// In app.ts or a similar file
app.use('/api/ai-Assistance', AIAssistanceRoutes.routes());
```

## Configuration

The server services are configured through environment variables and configuration files. This allows for different configurations in different environments (development, staging, production).

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure the services:

```typescript
// Example of using environment variables for configuration
const backendUrl = process.env._BACKEND_URL || 'https://default-backend-url.com';
```

### Configuration Files

Configuration files might also be used to provide more complex configuration:

```typescript
// Example of loading configuration from a file
const config = require('../config/services.json');
const backendUrl = config..backendUrl;
```

## Error Handling

The server services include error handling to ensure robust operation even in the face of failures.

### Logging

Errors are logged for debugging and monitoring:

```typescript
import { LOG } from '@osia/hades_core';

try {
  // Service operation
} catch (error) {
  LOG.error('Error in service operation:', error);
  // Additional error handling
}
```

### Error Responses

When services encounter errors, they provide appropriate error responses:

```typescript
// Example of error handling in a service
try {
  const result = await someOperation();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  throw new ServiceError('Operation failed', 500, error);
}
```

These error responses are then handled by the routes to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to the client.
